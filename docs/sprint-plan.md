## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| Tight timeline | High | Focus on MVP features only, defer nice-to-haves |
| Integration issues | Medium | Test integrations early, have fallbacks |
| Performance problems | Medium | Optimize critical paths, use pagination |
| Incomplete testing | High | Focus on critical path testing first |
